> **An @enchanted-plugins product — algorithm-driven, agent-managed, self-learning.**

**8 plugins. 5 named engines. 10 git hosts. 10 CI systems. 15 slash commands. Zero runtime deps.**

Built from the commit log of teams that ship: every flow exists because someone, somewhere, force-pushed their career off the edge.

Weaver is the git workflow layer you wrote yourself, if you'd had three months and a production-incident scar.

## Origin

Weaver takes its name from the **Weavers of Hollow Knight** — Hornet's ancestral kin, silk-spinners who wove threads into coherent patterns. Every branch is a thread; every merge stitches threads into history; every PR asks *does this fit the pattern?*

The question this plugin answers: *How does this ship?*

## Who this is for

- Teams working across multiple git hosts / CI systems who want one tool that speaks all of them — GitHub + GitLab + Bitbucket + the rest — via a single adapter contract.
- Engineers who've force-pushed their career off the edge once and want the destructive-op gate to catch the next one before it runs.
- Developers tired of manually classifying workflow (GitFlow vs. trunk vs. stacked) and having tools assume GitHub Flow — Weaver classifies before it acts.

Not for:

- Solo repos where you already know every command by muscle memory — Weaver's value scales with team size and host diversity.
- Teams who want a tool that **triggers** builds — Weaver reads CI; the Assembler boundary is explicit and enforced.

## How It Works

Weaver runs inside your Claude Code session and drives git on your behalf:

- **Watches every edit.** PostToolUse hooks feed W2 Jaccard-Cosine boundary segmentation. Logical tasks get clustered automatically.
- **Scaffolds branches.** W3 detects your workflow (GitHub Flow / Trunk-Based / GitFlow / Release Flow / Stacked Diffs) and names branches to match (`feat/x`, `feature/x`, `user/x`, bare-topic).
- **Drafts commits.** W1 Sonnet drafts a Conventional Commits message; Haiku + Python stdlib validate format + policy; SSH/GPG signed; DCO sign-off if the repo wants it.
- **Opens PRs.** W4 ranks reviewers (blame × recency × CODEOWNERS × availability), composes a 4-section body from W2 cluster + Hornet V4 continuity, dispatches to the right host adapter.
- **Reads CI.** ci-reader normalizes check runs from 10 systems. Never triggers a build itself (that's Assembler's lane).
- **Merges.** Strategy inferred from workflow; merge-queue-enqueues where configured.
- **Guards destructive ops.** weaver-gate intercepts `PreToolUse(Bash)` — force-push / filter-branch / clean -fdx / rebase-i-of-pushed etc. route through a Hornet-style decision-gate before they can run.
- **Learns.** W5 Gauss EMA adapts priors per-developer. Past sample 10, the defaults give way to what you actually do.

## What Makes Weaver Different

### It clusters the edit stream, not the commit stream

W2 Jaccard-Cosine Boundary Segmentation runs on `PostToolUse(Edit|Write)` — *before* commits exist. Distance `= α·(1−jaccard(files)) + β·(1−cosine(tokens)) + γ·tanh(idle/τ)`. At θ=0.55, a coherent task closes and the commit+PR logic fires. No timer-based batching, no manual `git add` discipline — just "did I finish a logical thing?"

### Every git host speaks the same contract

10 hosts, 1 `HostAdapter` contract: token resolution → authenticated request → normalized `PullRequest` return. Same `_rest.api_request` call path for GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Cloud / Data Center, Azure DevOps, Gitea, Forgejo, Codeberg, AWS CodeCommit, and SourceHut. When one host's JSON shape changes, exactly one file moves.

### Destructive ops route through a Hornet-style gate

`git push --force`, `git rebase -i <pushed-ref>`, `git clean -fdx`, `git filter-branch` — every destructive pattern routes through weaver-gate before it can run. Recovery windows documented per op; `clean -fdx` has zero; force-push to protected branches has zero bypass. No accidental career-enders.

### It learns per-developer, not per-repo

W5 Gauss Learning EMA runs per `(developer, surface)`. After 10 samples, the defaults give way to what you actually do — commit-subject verbosity, kebab vs. snake branch-name preferences, reviewer override patterns, W2 threshold corrections.

## The Full Lifecycle

A tool call flows through Weaver in five stages top-to-bottom: **SessionStart** (Haiku) loads the provider registry via `capability-memory`; **PreToolUse(Bash)** (Haiku) gates destructive ops via `weaver-gate`; **PostToolUse(Edit|Write)** (Sonnet) clusters edits via W2 Jaccard-Cosine boundary segmentation; on boundary close, the **commit + PR** stage (Sonnet) runs W3/W1/W4 to auto-branch, auto-commit, and open a draft PR with ranked reviewers; **PreCompact** (Sonnet) persists developer preferences via W5 Gauss Learning. The orthogonal `ci-reader` poll feeds W4's merge-queue gate.

## Install

Two commands in Claude Code + one per project:

```
/plugin marketplace add enchanted-plugins/weaver
/plugin install full@weaver
```

Then, from inside the repo you want to use Weaver on:

```
/weaver:setup
```

`/weaver:setup` is the **auto-configurator**: it runs `git remote get-url origin`, maps the URL to one of the 10 supported hosts, and does **only** the work that host needs — auto-installing the right tool via your platform's package manager (`winget` on Windows, `brew` on macOS, `apt`/`dnf`/`pacman` on Linux) and walking you through exactly one token prompt when required. No manual shell steps. No forced `gh` install if you're on GitLab.

If you skip setup entirely, Weaver runs in degraded mode — commit drafting + W2 task-boundary clustering + the destructive-op gate all work without any host credentials. Only PR opening / merging needs the host token.

<details>
<summary>What `/weaver:setup` does per host</summary>

| Host | What gets configured |
|---|---|
| GitHub | Uses the existing git-credential-manager token if present (the same one that authorizes `git push`). Otherwise offers to install `gh` + run `gh auth login`. |
| GitLab | Prompts for a PAT (api + write_repository scopes), stores via `git credential approve`. Handles self-managed via prompted api_base. |
| Bitbucket Cloud | Prompts for a Repository Access Token (App Passwords are deprecated). |
| Bitbucket Data Center | Prompts for api_base + HTTP PAT. |
| Azure DevOps | Prompts for PAT (Code + Pull Request scopes), org, project. |
| Gitea / Forgejo / Codeberg | Prompts for api_base + PAT. |
| AWS CodeCommit | Auto-installs `aws` CLI if missing; runs `aws configure` if no IAM identity resolves. |
| SourceHut | Configures the project's mailing-list address + `git send-email` OR SMTP credentials. |

</details>

---

## Quickstart

Install, probe the host, commit. Sixty seconds:

```
/plugin install full@weaver
/weaver:setup
/weaver:commit
```

Expected: `/weaver:setup` classifies your host + CI + auth in one pass, prompting only for a token when needed. `/weaver:commit` drafts a Conventional Commits message from the staged diff (W1 Sonnet + Haiku validate), signs it, and commits — without you touching `git commit -m`. See [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md) for the full first-PR walkthrough.

## 8 Plugins, 5 Agents, 15 Commands

| Plugin | Command(s) | What | Agent (tier) |
|--------|-----------|------|--------------|
| capability-memory | `/weaver:setup` | SessionStart: probe git host + CI + provider registry; cache capabilities | — (hook + skill) |
| boundary-segmenter | — (hook-only) | PostToolUse: W2 Jaccard-Cosine clusters edits into task boundaries | boundary-detector (Opus) |
| branch-workflow | `/weaver:branch`, `/weaver:workflow-detect` | Scaffold branches matching the W3-classified workflow | — (skill) |
| commit-intelligence | `/weaver:commit` | W1 Myers-Diff conventional-commits draft + policy validation + signing | commit-drafter (Sonnet), message-validator (Haiku) |
| pr-lifecycle | `/weaver:pr`, `/weaver:status`, `/weaver:reviewers`, `/weaver:merge`, `/weaver:close`, `/weaver:release`, `/weaver:revert` | PR open / monitor / merge / release / revert | conflict-resolver (Opus), pr-description-crafter (Opus) |
| ci-reader | `/weaver:ci-status`, `/weaver:retry-ci` | Normalize check runs across 10 CI systems; read-only | — |
| weaver-gate | `/weaver:dry-run` | PreToolUse(Bash) advisory gate for destructive ops | — (hook) |
| weaver-learning | `/weaver:learnings` | W5 Gauss EMA per-developer preference adaptation | — |

**Agent tier spread:** 3 Opus (boundary-detector, conflict-resolver, pr-description-crafter), 1 Sonnet (commit-drafter), 1 Haiku (message-validator) — orchestration on Opus, execution on Sonnet, validation on Haiku. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the tiering contract.

## What You Get Per Session

Four hook events fan out into six color-coded journals — one per sub-plugin whose state actually persists — and converge on the enchanted-mcp bus plus the 15-command query surface. Color maps engines to journals: blue = boundary-segmenter (W2) · amber = capability-memory · red = weaver-gate · yellow = commit-intelligence + pr-lifecycle (W1 + W4) · purple = weaver-learning (W5).

## Roadmap

Tracked in [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) and the shared [ecosystem map](https://github.com/enchanted-plugins/flux/blob/main/docs/ecosystem.md). For upcoming work specific to Weaver, see issues tagged [roadmap](https://github.com/enchanted-plugins/weaver/labels/roadmap). New host adapters, CI systems, and workflow classes are **not** breaking and land in minor releases; the ROADMAP captures engine-level changes.

## The Science Behind Weaver

| ID | Name | What it does | Algorithm |
|----|------|--------------|-----------|
| W1 | Myers-Diff Conventional Classifier | Drafts + validates Conventional Commits messages | Myers diff → rule-based classifier → LLM re-rank (Sonnet) + rules check (Haiku + Python) |
| W2 | Jaccard-Cosine Boundary Segmentation | Finds task boundaries in the edit stream | Online agglomerative clustering with multi-modal distance: α·(1−jaccard(files)) + β·(1−cosine(tokens)) + γ·tanh(idle/τ). α=β=0.4, γ=0.2, τ=300s, θ=0.55 |
| W3 | Workflow-Pattern Classifier | Detects GitHub Flow / Trunk-Based / GitFlow / Release Flow / Stacked Diffs | Weighted decision tree over branch-age distribution, protection rules, config-file markers, tag cadence. Per-subtree overrides via `.weaver/workflow-map.yaml` |
| W4 | Path-History Reviewer Routing | Ranks reviewers for a PR | Blame-graph scoring × recency (90-day half-life) × path-depth × CODEOWNERS boost × availability. Capped at 3 — no review storms |
| W5 | Gauss Learning (Weaver) | Per-developer preference adaptation | Exponential moving averages (α=0.3) over commit style, slug style, reviewer overrides, W2 corrections. Bootstrap floor at 10 samples |

Every engine has a formal-algorithm-level name. "Smart commit helper" is not a name. "Myers-Diff Conventional Classifier" is.

---

## All 15 Workflows

Everything a team does with git/PR/CI — wired through real host + CI adapters.

### Commits & branching

- **`/weaver:commit`** — draft + validate + sign + commit staged changes
- **`/weaver:branch`** — create a branch named per the detected workflow
- **`/weaver:workflow-detect`** — show W3's classification + rationale
- **`/weaver:revert`** — safe revert via new commit (never rewrites history)

### Pull requests

- **`/weaver:pr`** — open or update a draft PR with W2-cluster body + W4 reviewers
- **`/weaver:status`** — aggregate view of branch + commits + PR + CI + reviewers + merge queue
- **`/weaver:reviewers`** — rank reviewers without assigning (useful for web-UI workflows)
- **`/weaver:merge`** — merge with strategy inferred from workflow, or enqueue on a merge queue
- **`/weaver:close`** — close a PR without merging (for abandoned / superseded work)
- **`/weaver:release`** — tag + changelog + handoff to semantic-release / release-please / changesets / goreleaser

### CI & safety

- **`/weaver:ci-status`** — aggregate CI status across every configured system
- **`/weaver:retry-ci`** — rerun failing checks (existing runs only — new-build triggers are Assembler's lane)
- **`/weaver:dry-run`** — preview any git command through the destructive-op classifier without executing

### Learning

- **`/weaver:learnings`** — show W5 priors: commit style, slug style, reviewer overrides, W2 corrections

Every command has a markdown contract in `plugins/<name>/commands/*.md` — agents follow it; Claude Code dispatches the tools.

## 10 Git Hosts, All Real

No stubs. Every host has a full `HostAdapter` implementation. When credentials aren't configured, `is_authenticated()` returns False and ops raise `NotImplementedHostOp` cleanly — never silently fabricating a fake PR.

| Host | Transport | Auth | Status |
|------|-----------|------|--------|
| **GitHub** (Cloud + Enterprise) | urllib + gh fallback | `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` / git-credential-manager | Live-tested end-to-end |
| **GitLab** (SaaS + self-managed) | urllib | `GITLAB_TOKEN` / `GL_TOKEN` | Contract-tested |
| **Bitbucket Cloud** | urllib (REST 2.0) | `BITBUCKET_TOKEN` | Contract-tested |
| **Bitbucket Data Center** | urllib (REST 1.0, version-based PUTs) | `BITBUCKET_DC_TOKEN` | Contract-tested |
| **Azure DevOps** | urllib (Basic-wrapped PAT, api-version=7.1) | `AZURE_DEVOPS_TOKEN` / `VSTS_TOKEN` | Contract-tested |
| **Gitea** | urllib (GH-shape, `token` header) | `GITEA_TOKEN` | Contract-tested |
| **Forgejo** | urllib (subclass of Gitea) | `FORGEJO_TOKEN` / `GITEA_TOKEN` | Contract-tested |
| **Codeberg** | urllib (forgejo.codeberg.org) | `FORGEJO_TOKEN` / git-credential-manager | Contract-tested |
| **AWS CodeCommit** | `aws codecommit` CLI | AWS CLI config / IAM | Contract-tested |
| **SourceHut** | `git format-patch` + smtplib | SMTP / `git send-email` config | Contract-tested |

Every adapter follows the same contract: token resolution → authenticated request → normalized `PullRequest` return. The only structural difference is SourceHut, whose "PR" is an email thread to a mailing list — Weaver generates and sends the patch series; review happens in-list.

---

## 10 CI Systems, All Real

Same pattern: every CI adapter reads status via its native API (HTTP for most, `kubectl` for k8s-native). Returns a normalized `Check` list — empty when credentials/tooling are absent, never fabricated. Weaver reads; **Assembler runs.**

| System | Transport | Gate-ready? |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| GitHub Actions | urllib + gh (check-runs API) | Yes |
| GitLab CI | urllib (`/projects/:id/pipelines/:n/jobs`) | Yes |
| CircleCI | urllib (`Circle-Token` header) | Yes |
| Jenkins | urllib Basic auth, **treats UNSTABLE as failure** | Yes (with caveat) |
| Buildkite | urllib (SaaS control plane + agents) | Yes |
| Drone / Woodpecker | urllib (`/builds` or `/pipelines`) | Yes |
| Tekton | kubectl → PipelineRun CRDs | Yes (with kube access) |
| ArgoCD | kubectl → Application sync/health | Read-only (GitOps — drift surface) |
| FluxCD | kubectl → Kustomization Ready conditions | Read-only (GitOps) |

Jenkins gets its own note: **UNSTABLE is NOT success.** We learned that from the semantic-release / Jenkins incident where `status:SUCCESS` returned for a pipeline with `result:UNSTABLE` on a deploy stage. Weaver's Jenkins adapter requires `status == SUCCESS && result == SUCCESS` — anything else is non-green.

---

## The Decision-Gate Contract

Every destructive git operation routes through weaver-gate before it can run:

| Operation | Classification | Recovery window | Bypass |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| `git push --force` | Destructive | 30d (remote reflog) | `--yes-i-know` |
| `git push --force-with-lease` to protected branch | **Protected-destructive** | 30d | **Never** |
| `git rebase -i <pushed-ref>` | Destructive | 90d (local reflog) | `--yes-i-know` |
| `git filter-branch` / `filter-repo` | Destructive | 90d local / permanent remote | `--yes-i-know` + 5s countdown |
| `git reset --hard <past-pushed>` | Destructive | 90d | `--yes-i-know` |
| `git branch -D <unmerged>` | Destructive | 90d | `--yes-i-know` |
| `git push --delete <branch>` | Destructive | host-dependent (GitHub: 14d) | `--yes-i-know` |
| `git tag -d` | Destructive | 90d local / permanent remote | `--yes-i-know` |
| **`git clean -fdx`** | **Protected-destructive** | **0 (irrecoverable)** | **Never** |
| Merge-queue `--admin` bypass | Destructive | 0 (immediate) | `--admin-bypass` flag only |

Every gated op is audited to `plugins/weaver-gate/state/audit.jsonl` — append-only, Allay-A4 atomic write.

Weaver isn't replacing git. It's **the layer above it** that you were building piece-by-piece in every project anyway.

---

## Agent Conduct (10 Modules)

Every skill inherits a reusable behavioral contract from [shared/conduct/](shared/conduct/) — loaded once into [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md), applied across all plugins. This is how Claude *acts* inside Weaver: deterministic, surgical, verifiable. Not a suggestion; a contract.

| Module | What it governs |
|--------|-----------------|
| [discipline.md](shared/conduct/discipline.md) | Coding conduct: think-first, simplicity, surgical edits, goal-driven loops |
| [context.md](shared/conduct/context.md) | Attention-budget hygiene, U-curve placement, checkpoint protocol |
| [verification.md](shared/conduct/verification.md) | Independent checks, baseline snapshots, dry-run for destructive ops |
| [delegation.md](shared/conduct/delegation.md) | Subagent contracts, tool whitelisting, parallel vs. serial rules |
| [failure-modes.md](shared/conduct/failure-modes.md) | 14-code taxonomy for `state/learnings.json` so W5 Gauss Accumulation compounds |
| [tool-use.md](shared/conduct/tool-use.md) | Tool-choice hygiene, error payload contract, parallel-dispatch rules |
| [formatting.md](shared/conduct/formatting.md) | Per-target format (XML / Markdown sandwich / minimal / few-shot), prefill + stop sequences |
| [skill-authoring.md](shared/conduct/skill-authoring.md) | SKILL.md frontmatter discipline, discovery test |
| [hooks.md](shared/conduct/hooks.md) | Advisory-only hooks, injection over denial, fail-open |
| [precedent.md](shared/conduct/precedent.md) | Log self-observed failures to `state/precedent-log.md`; consult before risky steps |

## Testing

- **28 test assertions** passing (`bash tests/run-all.sh`) — unit, contract, and integration tiers. JSON validation, bash syntax check, Python functional smoke, end-to-end hook simulation.
- **1 live integration test** (`WEAVER_INTEGRATION=1 bash tests/run-all.sh`) — creates a real branch on `enchanted-plugins/weaver`, opens a real draft PR via the urllib adapter path (no `gh` required), round-trips it via `get_pr`, closes it, deletes the branch. Proven against real GitHub.
- **Contract test for every host** (`tests/pr-lifecycle/test-all-hosts-contract.sh`) — asserts every one of the 10 adapters instantiates cleanly, reports a bool `is_authenticated`, and refuses to fabricate a PR when credentials are absent.
- **Honest numbers.** What's verified live: GitHub only. What's verified by contract: all 10 hosts + 10 CI systems. The README doesn't pretend otherwise. When you drop a GitLab/Bitbucket/Azure token in, you're using the same `_rest.api_request` call path that shipped through GitHub's real API. If something breaks there, it's in the per-host JSON shape, not the flow.

## Acknowledgments

Weaver builds on foundations laid by others:

- **[Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)** (Anthropic) — the plugin surface this work extends.
- **[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)** — CHANGELOG convention.
- **[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)** — versioning contract.
- **[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)** — Code of Conduct.
- **[repostatus.org](https://www.repostatus.org/)** — status badge.
- **[Citation File Format](https://citation-file-format.github.io/)** — citation metadata.
- **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** — commit convention the W1 engine emits and Haiku validates.

W5 Gauss Learning shares the EMA update shape with Hornet's H6 Session Learning (see [docs/glossary.md](docs/glossary.md) § H-suffix references) — aligned patterns across siblings, independent implementations.

## Versioning & release cadence

Weaver follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Breaking changes land on major bumps only; the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) flags them explicitly. Release cadence is opportunistic — tags land when accumulated fixes or features justify a cut, not on a fixed schedule. Changes to the `HostAdapter` contract, the W3 classifier labels, the `weaver-gate` destructive-op classification, or the W2/W5 ledger shapes **are** breaking; new adapters, CI systems, and workflow classes are **not**. Migration notes between majors live in [docs/upgrading.md](docs/upgrading.md).

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). TL;DR: zero pip installs, honest scoring, per-sub-plugin structure identical, tests pass, Assembler boundary respected (Weaver reads CI; Weaver does not trigger builds).
