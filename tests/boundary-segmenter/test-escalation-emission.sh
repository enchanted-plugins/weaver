# Test: when W2 fires a boundary with confidence < WEAVER_BOUNDARY_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD
# (or uncertain:true), the hook must
#   1. still emit the weaver.task.boundary.detected event on boundary-events.jsonl
#   2. mark that event record with escalated:true
#   3. append a weaver.boundary.escalation.requested record to escalations.jsonl
#
# The drive: two edits on src/auth.py, followed by a context switch to docs/README.md
# after a 15-minute gap — that's the same pattern tests/boundary-segmenter/test-boundary-fires.sh
# uses to guarantee a boundary fires. Under default θ=0.55 the computed distance
# runs well above 0.6, so confidence (=1.0 - distance) lands below the 0.7 floor.
