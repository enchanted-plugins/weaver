# Case A — cohesive stream: no boundary fires → no escalation is appended.
#   A stream of same-file, same-token edits stays in one cluster. We observe
#   zero weaver.task.boundary.detected events and zero escalation records.
#
# Case B — high-confidence boundary (via tunable threshold): boundary fires
#   but WEAVER_BOUNDARY_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD is lowered so the computed
#   confidence is at/above the floor → boundary event is emitted with
#   escalated:false and escalations.jsonl remains empty.
